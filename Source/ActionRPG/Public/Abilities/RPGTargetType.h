 * Class that is used to determine targeting for abilities

 * This does not subclass GameplayAbilityTargetActor because this class is never instanced into the world
 * This can be used as a basis for a game-specific targeting blueprint
 * If your targeting is more complicated you may need to instance into the world once or as a pooled actor
